                      <h1>Safety Online</h1>
                      <p></p>

                      <p>The internet is primarily used to search for information, exchange ideas, conduct business transactions, communication and for the purpose of entertainment. There are many different types of activities that a person can be involved in when they are connected online. Many of these activities invole meeting new people and connecting with family and friends.

                      Social websites and chat rooms allow communication to take place between all types of people. Even though online chat rooms and social sites provide these types of services for many people there are risks associated with the use of these particular types of websites. Many people might not be aware of the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) which is a federal office that is used to take information regarding online scams and frauds as well as research information that will be used by law enforcement and prosecuting officials. This organization was started by two federal agencies which includes the National White Collar Crime Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. IC3 reports that the most common types of internet crimes includes scams where money is taken but no merchandise is delivered and identity theft. Other types of more serious crimes do occur online and some cases have been known to involve stalkers, con artists and murderers. One way that a chat room participant or a social site account holder can avoid these problems is by exercising safety precautions and rules.
                      <p></p>
                      The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is another governmental agency that also deals with identity theft and they give online users security information. One recommendation that the FTC endorses is not posting personal or private information online. They also warn social account holders not to communicate important and vital information with people inside of a chat room.
                      <p></p>
                      One of the primary ways that most identity thieves are able to steal a person's account information is through the use of a birth date. Most identity thieves have figured out that many people use their birthday numbers as a part of their passwords. These thieves also figured out that people have a tendency to use their family member birthdates as well.
                      <p></p>
                      This means that whenever a person posts their birth date information online they could become a victim of identity theft. Posting birth date infomation should not be done by anyone using a social account. If birth date information is a part of the application process for obtaining a social site then it should be set to private once the website is activated.
                      <p></p>
                      Another safety rule that must be implemented by online users is not posting any type of information which includes address information. For some reason many people like to post their location and their address. This is absolutely a dangerous thing to do when dealing with people online. No one can be absolutely sure about the type of people that are viewing their social site or the type of person that they are meeting inside of chat rooms. Posting address information increases a person's chances of being victimized by an online criminal.
                      <p></p>
                      People that have a social website account should consider setting their pages to private and allow them to be viewed only by their friends. They should also scrutinize any person that is making a friend's request before adding that person. Individuals should avoid using personal information for their online identity and they should avoid posting certain types of pictures that could cause a negative situation to arise. People might consider posting or revealing information on their sites that they feel comfortable about sharing.
                      <p></p>
                      As a rule of thumb, people should be wary about meeting online friends in person. First, let it be stated that not all online friends that a person meets in person is necessarily out to cause them harm. Keep in mind that the internet has opened up many possibilities for people to meet each other and there are many instances where people are able to form relationships and friendships with online friends, offline. The problem is that a few people have created a lot of problems for the many. Since there have been cases of stalking and the endangerment of peoples lives when meeting people who were once online friends; no one can afford to be unsafe if they decide to follow through with this process.
                      <p></p>
                      Once a person decides to meet an online friend in person they should do so during the daty time hours in a busy open place where they can be seen by many people. The first meeting should take place as an initial greeting and should not include a lot of time together. It is also recommended that a person bring a family member or friend who is able to provide an extra set of eyes in case something goes wrong with the meeting.
                      <p></p>
                      Make it a point to keep meeting a person out in public during the daytime for at least five visits and observe their behavior when you make this request. If a person becomes irritated, impatient and/or angry at an individual making these demands; then that person should probably be left alone.
                      <p></p>
                      This brings up the next point about online dating sites. These sites are designed to allow people to meet each other while protecting them from being harmed. Each dating site allows people to determine when and where they're going to meet and they usually have protocols in place that dictate how this process is supposed to be carried out. If a dating site allows people to chat then an account holder should engage with a potential date for at least two months. This way they can take the time to see what kind of person that they are dealing with. Dating people online can create an unwanted situation if a person cannot exercise caution and use their common sense in this type of situation.
                      <p></p>
                      Parents are responsible for safeguarding their children and teenagers when they're using the internet. They should monitor the sites that they're children are visiting and they should make sure that they have access to all of their children's online accounts. Installing a security program is also recommended for safety online.
                      <p></p>
                      All users who decide to buy or purchase products and services from online retailers should only do business with reputable and trusted sites. The sites that sell products should also have a working and current contact or customer service number that allows customers to contact them with ease. Most law enforcement officials encourage online users to exercise caution and common sense when using the internrt for various types of activities.
                      </p>
